# Advanced Filter for Kununu's Top Companies

[Kununu](https://www.kununu.com/)'s default [search](https://www.kununu.com/de/beste-arbeitgeber) for the current top companies based on predefined [criteria](https://arbeitgeberportal.kununu.com/top-company-siegel-box/) is quite limited.
Sorting by a descending [Kununu score](https://arbeitgeber-support.kununu.com/hc/de/articles/5140268998673-Der-kununu-Gesamt-Score-) shows mostly companies with only a few reviews.
These reviews are probably not representative and artificially boost a company's score. Furthermore, the number of reviews is correlated with the size of the company.
Therefore it is quite difficult to scout for mid-sized companies with a high score.
This tool fetches Kununu's Top Companies using their [RESTful JSON API]({kununu_search_url}) and provides an advanced filter and sort method.
